The User Hyperty Account contains URLs to [Hyperty Descriptors](../hyperty-catalogue/readme.md) and [User Identities](../user-identity/readme.md) that are associated with this account.

A User Hyperty Account contains two main types of data including:

1. Personal Configuration Data (or settings) used by the user to configure the Hyperty usage
1. User Hyperty Policies including Authorisation Policies with personal rules for the Hyperty execution behavior.
1. Authorisation Data including AccessTokens used by User Hyperty Authorisation policies. Similar to user identity authorisation data but now associated to a certain Hyperty.
