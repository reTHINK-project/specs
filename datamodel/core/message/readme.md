![Message Data Model](Message-Data-Model.png)

Header
------

Fields needed to route messages.

#### id

To be used to associate Response messages to the initial request message.

#### type

Message type that will be used to define the Message Body format.

#### from

[URL](../address/readme.md) of Hyperty instance or User associated with it

#### to

One or more [URLs](../address/readme.md) of Message recipients. According to the URL scheme it may be handled in different ways

### Message Body

Optionally, message bodies can contain JWT tokens for Access Control or for Identity Assertion purposes. See [here](../../../specs/dynamic-view/identity-management/user-identity-assertion.md) for more details.

The "MessageBody.via" attribute contains a list of all Protostub addresses (Protostub) that the message has been passed through. It is used to prevent infinite cycles in the Hyperty Messaging Framework.

The `MessageBody.source` contains the original creator of the message. Useful e.g. to identify the real source of the response to a one-to-many message delivery ie multiple responses coming from different sources.

The `MessageBody.auth` is used by the policy engine to set the Message was authorised (`true`) or that no policy was found by the Policy Engine to be enforced in this message (`false`).

The `MessageBody.p2p` is used by the Runtime Registry to decide if a P2P Connection Stub should be deployed (`true`) or not (`false`).

The `MessageBody.store` is used to decide if data associated with the message should be stored (`true`) or not (`false`).

#### CreateMessageBody

##### value

Contains the created object in JSON format.

##### policy

URL from where access policy control can be downloaded. Examples:

1.	reporter-observer where only reporter can make changes

2.	similar to previous one but observers can request reporters to make changes

Policy to be enforced by Monitor component colocated with Connector sandbox?

##### resume

Used for data sync resume procedures for data object reporters.

#### ResponseMessageBody

It should be note, the Request.id MUST be incremented every time a new Request message is created.
