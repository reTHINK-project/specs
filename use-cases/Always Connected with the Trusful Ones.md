## Actors

Alice and Bob are [Identified Consumer](../business-models/business-roles.md#identified-service-consumer) that are [Conversation Participants](../business-models/business-roles.md#conversation--communication-participant)

Alice and Bob are subscribers of [Communication Service Providers](../business-models/business-roles.md#communication-service-provider).

## Pre-conditions:

- Alice and Bob are [registered in their CSPs](../User%20Authentication%20and%20Registration.md).

- Alice and Bob trust each other e.g. they are married

- Alice and Bob context are published and known by each other

## Description

Trustful Humans can directly talk and share images or other digital resources (photos) each other with no need to perform the usual call setup procedure (invite, ring, accept).
- Alice checks Bob is available for talk, including some images from him captured a minute ago confirms he is having lunch alone
- Alice pushes a "talk and video" button and says "Hi Bob, pls don't forget to pick up the kids today from school"
- Bob immediately listens to what Alice said and watches her image in his screen. Pushes a "join" button and have a short conversation with her.

### Inter-domain

This use case is valid in case Alice and Bob are subscribers of different CSPs.

### Variant 1

Trust can be unidirectional e.g. Alice is Bob's boss and only Alice can directly talk with Bob but Bob can not directly talk with Alice.

## Differentiation – market relevance

Currently the call setup procedure is always the same and it does not take into account the level of trust between involved parties.
