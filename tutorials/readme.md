## Application development

Developers can use Hyperties in Applications by using any framework or tool, with a few lines of code as fully explained [here](development-of-apps.html).

You can start by having a look on [this example](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-app).

## Hyperty development

Currently the hyperty toolkit can be used to develop hyperties to be executed in the Browser or in the NodeJS.
You can find a quick start [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-hyperty-toolkit#quick-start) and full documentation [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-hyperty-toolkit/wiki) including the Hello World Hyperty.

A set of APIs are provided to help the development of Hyperties as documented [here](../service-framework)
